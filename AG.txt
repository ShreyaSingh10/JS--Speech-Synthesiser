Problems:-
1)When I slide on the range(pitch or rate) after each slide the toggle function
should invoke and the speech should start once again , but in my case the toggle function
is invoking after two slide like on moving it once the speech stops moving it again it starts again.

2)As showng in the video if i change the text in the text area and press enter the toggle function
should invoke and start the speech again with the new text , its not happening

3) adding EventListener to buttons shows error , I tried to workout with a lot of options from stack
oveflow its not helping

4)dats it for now!
